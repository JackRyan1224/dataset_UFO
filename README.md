The current status of the data collected is pretty consistetnt from month to month with slight up ticks during the summer months.

Name                     Description              
Year_month               Current month and year date from sighting
Month_count              Number of sightings in each month
Source                   Where the data was scraped from

Data although consistent has months in the early part of the year and summer that show higher counts of UFO sighting

Github is a newer platform that people are getting to master now and is a skill to be learned. I still need quite some time on here to fully understand what I am doing and to get the most out of it. It comes with time and commitment to learn it. I still don't feel entirely confident in my ability to use github to its fullest extent, but I am sort of understanding the basics. It is very powerful when combining repositories and keeping contributors up to date equally.
